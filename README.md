# OTExtension
Implementation of General OTExtension based on the paper [More Efficient Oblivious Transfer and Extensions for Faster Secure Computation](https://eprint.iacr.org/2013/552.pdf).

The implementation hasn't modelled the network, and it is assumed that the parties write the messages to be communicated, directly in the memory of the other party.
