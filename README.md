# MPC Protocols

## OTExtension
Implementation of General OTExtension based on the paper [More Efficient Oblivious Transfer and Extensions for Faster Secure Computation](https://eprint.iacr.org/2013/552.pdf).

## Garbled Circuits
Implementation of Garbled Circuits with free-XOR gates based on the paper [Improved Garbled Circuit: Free XOR Gates and Applications](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~vlad/papers/XOR_ICALP08.pdf).

**Note**: The implementations haven't modelled the network, and it is assumed that the parties write the messages to be communicated, directly in the memory of the other party.
